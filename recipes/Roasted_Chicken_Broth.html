        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Start this flavorful chicken broth by roasting the chicken first, then use all the dark meat to fortify the broth.</p>

        <H2>Ingredients</H2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 1/2) pound chicken, giblets removed</li>
            <li>1 onion, peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>1 rib celery, cut in chunks</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, lightly smashed</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
            <li>2 quarts cold water, or more as needed</li>
        </ul>
 

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place chicken, onion, and celery in a Dutch oven. Sprinkle salt over the top of the chicken.</li>
            <li>Roast chicken, uncovered, in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink inside, the skin is browned, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh reads 160 degrees F (70 degrees C), 45 minutes to 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a plate until cool enough to handle. Once cool, pick the meat from the bones; set aside chicken breast meat in a bowl for another purpose. Cover bowl of breast meat with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Discard chicken skin.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken fat from Dutch oven, leaving the brown flavor bits in the bottom of the Dutch oven. (See note for reserving drippings if desired.)</li>
            <li>Place the Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Return chicken bones and dark meat from drumsticks and thighs to the pot. Add garlic cloves, ketchup and cold water. Bring to a boil, and use a spoon to scrape up and dissolve the brown flavor bits from the bottom of the Dutch oven. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 3 hours, adding more water if needed to retain same level.</li>
            <li>As broth simmers, occasionally skim off and discard any foam that rises to the surface.</li>
            <li>Remove and discard bones, meat and vegetables. Strain broth through a fine mesh sieve to serve or use in recipes.</li>
        </ol>
